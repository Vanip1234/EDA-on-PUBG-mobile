# EDA-on-PUBG-mobile

PUBG (Player Unknown's Battlegrounds) is a hugely successful and popular online shooter game. It's of so-called "battle royale" type - the game ends when the last team stays alive on a map. The difference to the normal deathmatch is that after you are killed in battle royale game you're not re-spawned anymore(perma-death).

In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.
You are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 players per group.
